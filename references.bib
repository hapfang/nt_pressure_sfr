abstract = {Invariant analysis of the Reynolds stress tensor anisotropy can give an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of the turbulent structure of a turbulent flow. Lumley's triangle has proven to be a powerful representation of the invariant analysis of the second-order statistics collection provided by the Reynolds stress tensor. In the present work the spectral element code Nek5000 has been used to investigate the turbulent structure of the flow across a pressurized water reactor spacer grid with split type mixing vanes. Wall-resolved large eddy simulation of the flow in a prototypical rod bundle geometry at Re = 14,000 and P/D = 1.32 are performed and validated against particle image velocimetry data. The results are then used to perform an in-depth invariant analysis. The results show a reorganization of the Reynolds stresses components in the downstream region of the spacer grid. The mixing vanes orientation produces a symmetric behavior between sub-channels. The turbulent structure in the fully developed region has the typical behavior of fully-developed channel flow turbulence. When averaging the state across regions of the sub-channels, we observed a transition from disk-like turbulence in the mixing vanes region to rod-like turbulence in the fully developed region.},

abstract = {When constructing an experiment or simulation for flow through a wire-wrapped fuel rod bundle, scientists may utilize a smaller bundle than design in order to minimize material or computational costs. Small bundles may not capture the required flow physics experienced by larger bundles. This paper compares the flow fields through wire-wrapped rod bundles of 19, 37, 61, and 91 pins and investigates the ability of each to capture the relevant physics of a larger bundle. For model verification, the SST k-$\omega$ and elliptic blending k-∊ RANS models were compared against an LES simulation of the 19 pin domain, finding both RANS turbulent models capable for the given geometry. The central subchannel transverse velocity and inter-channel mass exchange for each bundle was compared, revealing a strong dependence of inter-channel mixing on the bundle size. Furthermore, analysis of the inter-channel mass exchange for subchannels at a varying distance from the surrounding shroud revealed than the mass exchange as a function of height is strongly tied to distance from the wall, with a slight adjustment in magnitude for the bundle size. The asymmetrical aspect of the wall effect was observed, revealing that the outside 2 or 3 rings of subchannels experience a large deviation from the characteristic subchannel behavior, but the central subchannels of the 37, 61, and 91 pin bundles are largely isolated from the asymmetric wall effect. Based on these findings the authors recommend a 37 pin bundle as the minimum surrogate for a larger bundle, and 61 pins as the preferred bundle size.},

abstract = {The proposition for molten salt and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors has increased the focus on the dynamics and physics in randomly packed pebble beds. Research is being conducted on the validity of these designs as a possible contestant for fourth-generation nuclear power systems. A detailed understanding of the coolant flow behavior is required in order to ensure proper cooling of the reactor core during normal and accident conditions. In order to increase the understanding of the flow through these complex geometries and enhance the accuracy of lower-fidelity modeling, high-fidelity approaches such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) can be utilized. Nek5000, a spectral-element computational fluid dynamics code, was used to develop DNS fluid flow data. The flow domain consisted of 147 pebbles enclosed by a bounding wall. In the work presented, the Reynolds numbers ranged from 430 to 1050 based on the pebble diameter and inlet velocity. Characteristics of the flow domain such as volume averaged porosity, axial porosity, and radial porosity were studied and compared with correlations available in the literature. Friction factors from the DNS results for all Reynolds numbers were compared with correlations in the literature. First- and second-order statistics show good agreement with available experimental data. Turbulence length scales were analyzed in the flow. Reynolds stress anisotropy was characterized by utilizing invariant analysis. Overall, the results of the analysis in the current study provide deeper understanding of the flow behavior and the effect of the wall in packed beds.},

abstract = {The DOE's Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) program is investigating a fast-flux irradiation facility that supports the experimentation and testing of a wide variety of fuel forms, materials, and advanced sensors for advanced nuclear energy systems. Core components are being considered which need to be evaluated for pressure drop. This includes calculation of local friction factors and form loss coefficients using the advanced computational fluid dynamics code, Nek5000. Due to the high Reynolds numbers expected in the VTR ( 106), RANS methods are necessary. A wall-resolved regularized k-! turbulence model is used to perform simulations at the target Reynolds numbers. However, this method must be evaluated for its performance in the complex flow geometries associated with reactor core components. Therefore, simulations using both LES and RANS models are performed at moderate Reynolds numbers to provide a direct comparison. Results from both models are compared to the most applicable literature correlations where available. Simulations have been performed for two potential designs of the upper and lower reflectors. A straight channel design considered a semi-circular channel on each of three of the outside faces of a regular hexagonal assembly. The inlet and outlet sections were on opposing sets of faces, representing a 120 rotation with an abrupt transition between the two sections. This design was analyzed for both pressure drop and maximum temperature due to gamma heating. All models predicted a large pressure drop associated with this geometry The results of the gamma heating analysis predicted a maximum temperature well within acceptable thermal margins. A second design considered curved channels with no abrupt transition. Significantly lower pressure drops were predicted for the second design, with good agreement between RANS results, LES results, and literature correlations. Further components are being explored, initially focusing on sections of a fuel assembly.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of numerical techniques and the availability of increasingly powerful supercomputers recently enabled scientists to use large eddy simulation (LES) to simulate numerically the flow in a full subassembly composed of wire-wrapped pins. Because of the extreme computational cost of such simulations, it was not possible to conduct a sensitivity case on the pin-wire interface modeling. Since such calculations are likely to be extended to conjugate heat transfer, however, a sensitivity study is necessary to assess the reliability of the numerical results. It is well known, for example, that conjugate heat-transfer results are often strongly influenced by near-wall modeling. The objective of the present work is to investigate the effect of pin-wire contact modeling from the point of view of both the hydraulics and the heat transfer characteristics. In particular, the focus is on the prediction of the hot spot in conjugate heat-transfer calculations. The primary test case is the simplified geometry recently proposed by Ranjan et al., which consists of a simple channel flow with a wire embedded in one of the walls. After reproducing the results using the LES code Nek5000, we examined several other choices for the wire-pin interface modeling, including the introduction of a nominal gap between the wire and wall. The results shed light on the sensitivity of CFD calculations results to the modeling of the interface region between wires and pins.},

abstract = {AbstractFlow-induced vibration (FIV) is a widespread problem in energy systems as they rely on fluid movement for energy conversion. Vibrating structures may be damaged as fatigue or wear occur. Given the importance of reliable components in the nuclear industry, FIV has long been a major concern in the safety and operation of nuclear reactors. In particular, nuclear fuel rods and steam generators have been known to suffer from FIV and related failures.In this paper we discuss the use of the computational fluid dynamics code Nek5000 coupled to the structural code Diablo to simulate the flow in helical coil heat exchangers and associated FIV. In particular, one-way coupled calculations are performed, where pressure and tractions data are loaded into the structural model. The main focus of this paper is on validation of this capability. Fluid-only Nek5000 large eddy simulations are first compared against dedicated high-resolution experiments. Then, one-way coupled calculations are performed with Nek5000 and Diablo for two data sets that provide FIV data for validation. These calculations were aimed at simulating available legacy FIV experiments in helical steam generators in the turbulent buffeting regime. In this regime one-way coupling is judged sufficient since the pressure loads do not cause substantial displacements. It is also the most common source of vibration in helical steam generators at the low flows expected in integral pressurized water reactors. We discuss validation of two-way coupled experiments and benchmarks toward the simulation of fluid elastic instability. We briefly discuss the application of these methods to grid-to-rod fretting.},

abstract = {An alternative methodology is proposed here to overcome the excessive cost of large eddy simulations (LES) of full-length heated rod bundle calculations, while improving the inaccurate results typically obtained with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS). While the cost of the full-length LES is generally too high, LES of a small section of a single rod is usually affordable. The idea presented here consists of using the information granted by the small LES calculation to determine the appropriate turbulence viscosity or turbulent thermal diffusivity that can be used to solve only for the temperature field in a pseudo-RANS approach. The study has been performed with single-rod simulations with a P/D of 1.12 and 1.24, considering rod lengths that are representative of reactor applications, for the cases of uniform heat flux and a more realistic cosine-like axial heat distribution. The spectral element code Nek5000 has been used for all LES, RANS, and pseudo-RANS simulations. The recently proposed Nek5000 steady-state solver has been used for solving the temperature field in the pseudo-RANS approach and has proved significantly faster than transient schemes. Prediction of thermal quantities is compared with classical linear and nonlinear RANS models. LES for the full-length rods has also been performed and is used as a reference. Results of the proposed method show significant improvements with respect to those obtained with RANS.},

abstract = {The spectral element code Nek5000 is an open-source, higher-order computational fluid dynamics code developed at Argonne National Laboratory. It is designed to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, but it also has a low-Mach-number approximation feature available. Large eddy simulation is approached by explicit filtering of the velocity field (and other fields) to mimic the effect of dissipation due to the unresolved scale. The computational domain is decomposed into second-order hexahedral elements that conform to the boundaries. However, generating a high-quality pure-hexahedral mesh can be challenging for some problems. For simple geometries, traditional blocking methods can be used to decompose the domain into smaller blocks to generate a so-called structural mesh. A structural mesh can maintain good orthogonality but can have a highly skewed mesh to conform to the geometry, as well as unnecessary refinement in the far field. Moreover, for geometries with relative complexity, blocking the geometry becomes impossible. To address these issues, we adopted a tet-to-hex strategy to generate a pure hexahedral mesh for Nek5000. First, we generate a pure tetrahedral mesh for the geometry; then we divide one tetrahedral element into four hexahedral elements. A pure tetrahedral mesh could be easily generated for complex geometries by using many current meshing codes. In this paper, we use the commercial codes ANSYS meshing and ANSYS ICEM to generate the pure tetrahedral mesh and then convert it to a pure hexahedral mesh. Boundary layers are extruded in ANSYSICEM to maintain near-wall resolution.},

The ability to decompose a global domain into separate, but overlapping, subdomains eases mesh generation procedures and increases flexibility of modeling flows with complex geometries. The methodology employs implicit spectral element discretization of equations in each subdomain and explicit treatment of subdomain interfaces with spectrally-accurate spatial interpolation and high-order accurate temporal extrapolation, and requires few, if any, iterations, yet maintains the global accuracy and stability of the underlying flow solver. The overlapping mesh methodology is thoroughly validated using two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark problems in laminar and turbulent flows. The spatial and temporal convergence is documented and is in agreement with the nominal order of accuracy of the solver. The influence of long integration times, as well as inflow–outflow global boundary conditions on the performance of the overlapping grid solver is assessed. In a turbulent benchmark of fully-developed turbulent pipe flow, the turbulent statistics with the overlapping grids is validated against published available experimental and other computation data. Scaling tests are presented that show near linear strong scaling, even for moderately large processor counts.},
